# New skill #1

[SUBJECT]=Topic or skill to learn  
[CURRENT_LEVEL]=Starting knowledge level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)  
[TIME_AVAILABLE]=Weekly hours available for learning  
[LEARNING_STYLE]=Preferred learning method (visual/auditory/hands-on/reading)  
[GOAL]=Specific learning objective or target skill level  

Step 1: Knowledge Assessment

1. Break down [SUBJECT] into core components
1. Evaluate complexity levels of each component
1. Map prerequisites and dependencies
1. Identify foundational concepts Output detailed skill tree and learning hierarchy

Step 2: Learning Path Design

1. Create progression milestones based on [CURRENT_LEVEL]
1. Structure topics in optimal learning sequence
1. Estimate time requirements per topic
1. Align with [TIME_AVAILABLE] constraints Output structured learning roadmap with timeframes

Step 3: Resource Curation

1. Identify learning materials matching [LEARNING_STYLE]:
	- Video courses
	- Books/articles
	- Interactive exercises
	- Practice projects
1. Rank resources by effectiveness
1. Create resource playlist Output comprehensive resource list with priority order

Step 4: Practice Framework

1. Design exercises for each topic
1. Create real-world application scenarios
1. Develop progress checkpoints
1. Structure review intervals Output practice plan with spaced repetition schedule

Step 5: Progress Tracking System

1. Define measurable progress indicators
1. Create assessment criteria
1. Design feedback loops
1. Establish milestone completion metrics Output progress tracking template and benchmarks

Step 6: Study Schedule Generation

1. Break down learning into daily/weekly tasks
1. Incorporate rest and review periods
1. Add checkpoint assessments
1. Balance theory and practice Output detailed study schedule aligned with [TIME_AVAILABLE]
